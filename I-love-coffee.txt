I love coffee. I love the Folger’s drip coffee I pour piping hot into my thermos every morning. I love the San Francisco Fog Chaser brew that I sip over the pages of the Economist. I love it black and steamy, sweet and milky, caffeinated and decaf. Whether savoring it in the Church’s breakfast room after the 9:30 AM service or on the Starbuck’s patio with my friends, I simply, irrevocably, just love coffee.

The University of Chicago, my tour guide proclaimed, is a “coffee campus”. He excitedly pointed to buildings around the quad, listing various coffee shops. Finally, his finger arrived at the Divinity School.

“The Grounds of Being is hands down the best coffee you are ever gonna get!” he exclaimed.
