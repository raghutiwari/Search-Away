I am convinced that sandwiches are truly one of a kind; comparable to snowflakes in their degree of distinction. Yes, it would be possible “recreate” your favorite sourdough, smoked trout, olive tapenade, roasted pepper concoction, but would it be as good as it was the first time? Would the proportions of each ingredient be exactly the same? Would the flamboyant toothpicks protruding from each half be at the precise angle they were originally? Down to the atom, was the bisecting chop performed at the identical location? No! Of course not, that is ridiculous; so is the notion that it is possible to return to what was before.

Square one is a foundation, an origin or a beginning and a restart all at the same time. Depending on the frame of reference, square one can be anything from the anchor word in a game of ​Ban​ anagrams, to the Big Bang which kick started our universe. But for me, the sandwich, from peanut butter and jelly to hot dogs (technically a folded open face), is the perfect tool to analyze this phenomenon of “square one.”
